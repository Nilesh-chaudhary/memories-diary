## **🔥 Motivation**:
From the start of this year 2022, I was thinking of creating a project for myself and can also be used by others for themselves, so as to gain experience and more learning I thought of creating a web app like a digitial album.  
There happens many events on one's lives but we tend to forget about it soon and lost it. So this webapp helps the user to upload the memories with photos directly to the server and can see it later when required. I tried to find a similar service which can do the same woork as above but not found anything. Social media is one thing aside but we cannot upload our small achievements on socials everytime. Another thing is that we can made it availaible in Mobiles gallery but to find things will be difficult sometimes. 
So, I thought 💡 of creating a similar service, which can be used by others to create memories in a web app.

## **🔮 Future Plans:**
1. Add pagination to get better user experience.
2. Add authentication so that only authorized user can access the posts.
3. Change UI to look better.
4. Option to make memory private or public based on user choice.
5. Feature to search memories based on Tags.
6. Upgrading from **#7DaysOfCode** to **#100DaysOfCode**🚀.
7. implement feature so that it can directly suggest tags based on image.
8. Integrating **AI/ML** 🤖 to send Notifaction based on tags to the user for certain good events after anniversery of the memory.
